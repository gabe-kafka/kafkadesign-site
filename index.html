<h2 id="structural_terminal"><a href="/structural-terminal.html">Structural Terminal</a></h2>
<p>This is my attempt at a structural design "terminal". When I was designing wood framed 
  buildings in Boston there were maybe 10 resources I wanted to be able to access from one place as quickly 
  as possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Godel terminal for screening stocks, gave me the idea to set up the beta version of this 
  product. One of these days I will take another pass at it. For now, type in LVL and click enter to see some 
  table values, without searching through folders.

<h2 id="low-rise-wind"><a href="/low-rise-wind.html">Low Rise Wind Loading Notebook</a></h2>
<p>
This is based off of the ASCE7-16/22 CH28 simplified wind loading for low rise buildings meeting 
certain criteria which are worked into the script. The goal od this script is to make you very fast 
for very simple less than 60' tall buildings.
