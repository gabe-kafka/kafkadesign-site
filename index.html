<h2 id="structural_terminal"><a href="/structural-terminal.html">Structural Terminal</a></h2>
<p>This is my attempt at a structural design "terminal". When I was designing wood framed 
  buildings in Boston there were maybe 10 resources I wanted to be able to access from one place as quickly 
  as possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Godel terminal for screening stocks, gave me the idea to set up the beta version of this 
  product. One of these days I will take another pass at it. For now, type in LVL and click enter to see some 
  table values, without searching through folders.

<p>These are python notebooks based off of the relevent buildings codes that make you fast af.
